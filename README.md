# DOGE Miner

This will use [xmrig](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig) to mine DOGE. Tested on Debian 11 and Raspberry Pi OS.

Don't expect profit, especially if you're using the Raspberry Pi. What you can do is mine the coins, and hope their value increases.

# Debian Install (run as root)
```bash
bash <(wget --no-check-certificate -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aristosv/DOGE-Miner/main/install_debian)
```

# Raspberry Pi OS Install (run as pi)
```bash
bash <(wget --no-check-certificate -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aristosv/DOGE-Miner/main/install_raspberrypios)
```

After the setup go to https://unmineable.com/ and paste your wallet address to view additional information.
